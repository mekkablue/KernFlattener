# KernFlattener.glyphsPlugin

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).

The plugin works with the "Export kern Table" custom parameter (in instances). It reduces the number of kerning pairs that are written to the kern table (not the kern feature) by filtering with a list of frequent kerning pairs.

The pair was made by Andr√© Fuchs: https://github.com/andre-fuchs/kerning-pairs

### Requirements

The plugin needs Glyphs 3.3 or higher, running on OS X 10.11 or later. It does NOT work with Glyphs 3.2 and earlier.
